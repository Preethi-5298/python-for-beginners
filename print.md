# The print function 

The very first thing that is worth learning in Python is the print function. This is something you will be using a lot of in your Python programming journey and it has a very important purpose. 

## What does it do?

Typing out print, followed by parentheses(), is the function that places your content onto the screen, allowing you to see the results of your code. 

## Open your text editor

Which text editor are you using? Whatever one you have chosen to use, make sure it is set up to use, display and run Python code. For my examples and in all of the following files I will refer to my own chosen text editor, Visual Studio Code. Ensuring VS Code is set up for optimal Python usage is a job in itself, so please ensure you have followed the instructions for creating your environment first before attempting your first program. 

## Hello World!

Let's start your first ever Python program by typing <pre><code> print("Hello World!")</code></pre>

Run your Python code in the terminal or console, or if you're using VS Code, right click and select "Run python file in terminal". This will bring up an inbuilt terminal within VS Code to display the output of your code.
