# Booleans

## What is a Boolean?

A boolean is a computing variable that equates to either true or false ONLY and can have no other result. True or false can also be represented in numeric terms:

1 = True
0 = False

Boolean's are called comparison operators and are used to compare two different values or variables to decide whether to carry out an operation or not.
