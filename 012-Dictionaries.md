# Dictionaries

## What are dictionaries in Python?

Dictionairies are a collection of data in the format of 'key and variable', so each element contains two pieces of information. 

```Python 
my_dict = {'Orange':50, 'Apples':80, 'Bananas':99}

```
The above example shows how dictionaries are displayed, and their key:value pairing syntax.
