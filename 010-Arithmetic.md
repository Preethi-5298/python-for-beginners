# Arithmetic

## Arithmetic in Python

Python is a wonderful language for solving mathematical problems, and the programming side of things can be just as difficult to grasp as working out how to implement arithmetic and mathematical solutions. 

Whether it is working out the circumference of a square, or general addition or subtraction, Python can be used to provide answers and solutions to your problems. 

Many programs, no matter which language you are using, require the need to solve mathematical solutions, and because Python is extremely useful in Data Analysis it is very often a requirement to implement problem solving within Python scripts.
