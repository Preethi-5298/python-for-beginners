# Integers

## What is an integer?

An integer is a whole number, commonly used in most programming languages. Integers, (often referred to as an 'int') has no decimal point at the end of it, even if a zero follows the decimal point. 

## Integer examples

Here is a list of numbers. ALL of these are integers:

- 3
- 67
- 492
- 7969276459827034
- 100000
- 1

## What can I do with integers in Python?

Variables can be used to store integer values. If you need to know what a variable is take a look at the chapter entitles 'variables.md'.

Here is an example of a variable with a value that is an integer:

<pre><code>oranges = 6
apples = 9

basket = oranges + apples

print(basket)

Output: 15</code></pre>

When assigning an integer to a variable there is no need for quotation marks or any other defining decoration around the number. Place a number within quotation marks would make the number a 'string' and mathematical equations could not longer be used on the numbers. See the 'string' chapter to find out what a string in Python is. 

### Basically, an integer is ANY whole number!
