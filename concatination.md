# Concatination

## What is concatination?

Some operators can be used when dealing with strings, such as multiplcation and addition. This works very differently with strings than it does when dealing with integers or floating numbers. Adding two strings together squashes each string to the other one in a literal fashion. 

Take a look at this example:

<pre><code>"I would like to" + " visit Disney World in Florida."</code></pre>

Notice here we have two strings, with an addition operator in the middle of them.
