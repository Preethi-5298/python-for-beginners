# Strings

## What is a string?

A string is a collection of characters, which can include letters, numbers and even punctuation. 

## How are strings defined and displayed in Python?

A string can be a data type and can be assigned to a variable name. Whenever we give a variable name string data, we put place the string inside quotations marks. Take a look at this example:

<pre><code>string_variable = "I am a string!"</code></pre>
