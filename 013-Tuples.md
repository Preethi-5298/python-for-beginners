# Tuples

## What are tuples in Python?

Tuples are sequences just like lists, except they are <em>immutable</em>. Immutable objects cannot be changed or updated in the same way a list can. They are less flexible, however this means they are easier to manage and control. Sorting or extracting parts of a list can bring back unexpected results, and so sometimes the use of tuples can be an advantage. 

## How to display tuples

A tuple is displayed within brackets () and separated by commas. A tuple can contain a mixture of strings and numbers.
Here is an example of a tuple:

```python
my_tuple = ('birthday', 'christmas', 'new year', 1988, 2010, 2018)
```
