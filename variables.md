# Variables in Python

Python is a dynamically typed programming language meaning that you do not need to tell the script or program exactly what type of value a variable holds. There are many types of 'values' which we discuss in the values chapter. A variable holds onto information using a key word. You can find a word, and assign information to that word, and then call upon that word multiple times for use throughout the program. 

## How to make a variable

A variable is created by giving it a name and then assigning its contents to it with a single equals sign, for example:
<pre><code>example = "value"</code></pre>
